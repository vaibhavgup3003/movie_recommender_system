# Working
This model first of all create labels for each movie by combining the various feature of the movies such as (genre, overview, top 3 casts, director).
Then each movie is `vectorized` using `bag of words` method.
Then similarity score of each movie with every other movie is calculated using `cosine similarity`

# Cosine Similarity
Basic Cosine similarity is distance between the two vectors in the multi-dimensional space on the basis of the angle between vectors. Smaller is the angle between vectors higher is the similarity between them.
